# Location API

This is a rewrite of a Java API for user locations. There is no authentication included at this stage. The API is fully REST-ful with **/users/** being the main endpoint. 


# Installation

Simply clone the git repository and use **composer** to setup all of the dependencies by using:
```
composer install
```
You can get composer by following this link: [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)


# Swagger

The API contains Swagger-UI distribution in offline mode which is manually setup to contain a basic front-end to the API and give you a better idea of how the API runs. Simply go to /swagger/ directory within the public folder to find out more information about this.
